My code implements a recursive function of fib. During the discussion in class, the professor had written a rather easier formula to code through, that was stated in a recursive manner. One thing lacking in my code was throwing exceptions and having if statements on restrictions of inputs (negative, too large values to compute). Due to time restrictions and concern over knowing the material for academic assessments, I had cut off time to develop a better and suitable code to trade in for studying time (although I do have if statements for if inputs were 0 or 1 to prove my knowledge and assembly). If the chance may be, I would love to resubmit my assignment appropriately.
In any case, my program starts off with utilizing the template provided in blackboard, giving details about the assignment. Once the data values have been established, I moved onto the main methods. Here I load and print out the prompt ($a0) in order to decipher what n is. I read the integer into $v0, and move it to $t2. I jump to fib to get started.
I have if statements in the beginning of fib about the inputs. If n=0, I would return 0, and if n=1, I would return 1. I store the address and subtract $a0, as it is the loops counter. I call fib once again and restore the return address from the stack. I follow this procedure and finally add the values into $v0. Returning to main, I load the answer and print it out. Then I terminate the program.
