This program is implemented by a stack sort. It utilizes the $sp function to locate and address code accordingly. There is a for loop that first loops accordingly to how many integers the user wants to input, which is taken before the loop. The loop iterates as many times as the user wants to input, and sorts it accordingly and immediately. Then, another for loop is made for printing out the stack in order. 
Here my code creates an iterator value and compare result. It first prints out a prompt for clarification for the user, and takes in n. I have a loop called loop that checks if the iterator is equal to n (that goes directly to printing otherwise). It reads the integer and jumps to insert to sort. This loop keeps looping until n is equal to the iterator. In insert, I tried to sort out the list by comparing it to values and adjusting it accordingly. After all the inputs have been received and adusted, it returns to loop and directly goes to a print loop where it prints out values in a piority queue.
